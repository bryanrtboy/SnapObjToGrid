This project is a utility for creating several things that are useful in making a game in Unity. This full project includes tools to do the following:
* Create a Grid of tiles based on a single Cubes size and location
* Create a button interface with thumbnails generated automatically
* Create a system to drop objects into the scene, landing on an unoccupied tile
* Move and rotate objects based on the tile location
* Freely slide objects on the floor, or snap objects to the center of the tile location

The thumbnail generator is using Yasirkula's excellent [UnityRuntimePreviewGenerator](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityRuntimePreviewGenerator) script.
